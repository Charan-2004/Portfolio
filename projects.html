      Helical Antenna Design Using CST Tool:
      <ul><li>
        Objective: Designed a helical antenna focused on the ultra-high frequency (UHF) range at 2.45 GHz.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Tools Used: CST Studio Suite.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>  Details: This project involved the design and simulation of a helical antenna to operate efficiently at 2.45 GHz.
         The project required a deep understanding of antenna theory, electromagnetic waves, and simulation techniques. 
         The antenna was modeled to meet specific criteria for gain, bandwidth, and impedance matching, 
         making it suitable for various UHF applications.</li></ul>
      <ul><li> Role: Led the project, handled the design and simulation, and presented the findings.

      Four-Wheel Obstacle-Avoiding Rover Using Arduino Uno:
      <ul><li>
        Objective: Developed a four-wheel rover capable of autonomously avoiding obstacles using sensors and an Arduino Uno.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Tools Used: Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors, Servo Motors, C++ Programming.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>  Details: This project involved designing and programming a rover that can navigate through an environment 
        while avoiding obstacles. The rover uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and a servo motor to adjust its path accordingly.
         The project emphasized practical applications of embedded systems and sensor integration.</li></ul>
      <ul><li> Role: Led the project team, designed the circuit, wrote the C++ code for sensor integration and motor control, 
        and ensured successful implementation.
