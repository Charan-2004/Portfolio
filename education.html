          I completed my Pre-University (12th grade) education in Science at BGS PU College, Mysore. 
          This phase of my education provided a solid foundation in subjects like Physics, Chemistry,
           and Mathematics, which later played a crucial role in my pursuit of a Bachelor of Engineering
            in Electronics and Communication.
